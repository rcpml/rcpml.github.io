            <h2>MOVE FORWARD</h2>
            <p>
              We automatically — and mostly without realizing — set a reference level for everything we do. Sometimes we even limit ourselves because of this. Reference levels define how far we can learn and move forward in our lives. Although we have these levels, we are not aware of them as they become automatic and guide our lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can practice learning a new skill by working for it 1 hour a day and quit after a while because it looks and feels so difficult. On the other hand, you can decide to increase the duration of your practice, redesign your learing strategy and learn that skill step by step to conquer your limit on that.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here, you have changed your reference level and made a difference for yourself. Thus, in your next attempts to learn a new skill, you will not easily give up and change your reference level (increasing the way or the duration of practice) to succeed. It will feel uncomfortable in the beginning, however, it is worth it without doubt.
            </p>
            <p>
              Final remark: Things that are far away (e.g., important tasks, skills that require serious time to learn) and those which are not split into attainable smaller parts look more difficult and unattainable than they really are. Consider this next time when you feel overwhelmed by something.
